A Library Management System (LMS) is a software solution designed to manage and streamline all operations of a library. 
It automates the key functions of a library such as cataloguing, book circulation (issue and return), acquisitions, inventory management, and maintenance of library materials.
The LMS ensures efficient tracking of books, members, transactions, and resources, reducing manual errors and improving overall productivity.
The system allows librarians to create and manage detailed records of books (title, author, ISBN, edition, shelf location), handle member registrations, process book loans and returns, generate overdue alerts, and monitor the status and condition of library items. 
It also supports acquisition workflows for new books, vendor management, damaged book repairs, and disposal tracking.
Members benefit by being able to easily search for books, check availability, place requests, renew items, and receive reminders. 
Administrators gain visibility into library performance through dashboards and reports such as popular books, overdue lists, inventory counts, and cost analysis.
Overall, the Library Management System simplifies day-to-day library operations, ensures transparency and accuracy in record-keeping, improves service efficiency, and supports informed decision-making for library staff and management.
